# IN PROGRESS
# What is this?
This is my attempt at writing a compiler for simple C-like imperative language that targets my custom [runtime.](https://github.com/lar9482/AssemblySimulator)

# Goals for the compiler
- [x] Lexical Analysis
- [x] Syntactic Analysis
- [ ] Type checking
- [ ] Other static analysis
- [ ] IR generation
- [ ] Converting IR to assembly language in the runtime
- [ ] Optimization somewhere?
